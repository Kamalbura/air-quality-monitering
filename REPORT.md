# Air Quality Monitoring System - Technical Report

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive web-based air quality monitoring system designed to collect, analyze, and visualize particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), temperature, and humidity data from environmental sensors. The system provides real-time monitoring, historical data analysis, and various visualization tools to help users understand air quality trends and patterns.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture with the following components:

### Backend Architecture

- **Server**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Template Engine**: EJS for server-side rendering
- **Data Sources**:
  - ThingSpeak IoT platform integration
  - Local CSV file storage
- **Data Processing**:
  - JavaScript-based statistical analysis
  - Optional Python integration for advanced processing
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for data access and manipulation

### Frontend Architecture

- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- **Visualization**: Chart.js with various plugins for data visualization
- **Data Rendering**: Client-side dynamic content generation
- **Interactivity**: Real-time updates and filtering capabilities

### Key Components

1. **Dashboard Interface** - Main user interface displaying air quality metrics and visualizations
2. **Data Analysis Engine** - Statistical processing for air quality data
3. **Visualization System** - Multiple chart types for data representation
4. **Data Export/Import** - CSV file handling for data portability
5. **System Monitoring** - Status checking and diagnostics
6. **Caching Layer** - Performance optimization for API requests

## Core Features

### Data Collection & Storage

The system collects air quality data from:

- ThingSpeak IoT channels (remote sensors)
- Uploaded CSV files (historical or offline data)
- Local storage for persistence

Data is stored in a structured format with timestamps and properly formatted metrics.

### Data Analysis Capabilities

The system uses `analysis-helper.js` to perform:

- Basic statistics (mean, median, min, max)
- Correlation analysis between different metrics
- Daily pattern recognition
- Data quality validation
- Trend analysis

The analysis supports both real-time and historical data processing, providing immediate insights while maintaining performance.

### Visualization Options

Multiple visualization types are supported:

- **Time Series Charts** - Tracking metrics over time
- **Daily Pattern Analysis** - Showing how metrics vary by hour of day
- **Heatmaps** - For correlation and density visualization
- **Correlation Plots** - Revealing relationships between different metrics

Visualization can be performed client-side for interactivity or server-side for consistency and resource management. The system automatically falls back to simpler visualizations when necessary.

### Dashboard Interface

The dashboard provides:

- Real-time metric updates
- Summary cards showing key statistics
- Interactive charts with zoom and pan capabilities
- Data filtering by date and time ranges
- Dark/light theme toggle for viewing comfort
- Responsive design for various device sizes

### System Diagnostics

A dedicated status page offers:

- ThingSpeak connection status
- API endpoint testing
- Cache management
- System health checks
- Error reporting

### Data Export

Users can download data in CSV format with:

- Customizable date ranges
- All collected metrics included
- Properly formatted timestamps
- Ready for external analysis in tools like Excel

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. Data is collected from ThingSpeak API or local CSV files
2. Preprocessing normalizes and validates the data
3. Analysis engine calculates statistics and identifies patterns
4. Visualization components render the data in various formats
5. User interface presents information and accepts user interactions
6. Export functionality allows data to be saved externally

### Key Files and Their Functions

- **server.js**: Main application entry point and Express.js configuration
- **dashboard.js**: Client-side logic for the main dashboard interface
- **analysis-helper.js**: Statistical processing and data analysis

- **thingspeak-service.js**: Integration with ThingSpeak IoT platform
- **visualization-config.js**: Configuration for visualization options
- **error-handler.js**: Centralized error management
- **security-middleware.js**: Request validation and security controls

### Error Handling

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

- Centralized error logging and reporting
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed error logs for troubleshooting

### Performance Optimization

Performance is optimized through:

- API response caching
- Efficient data processing algorithms
- Progressive loading of historical data
- Client-side rendering when appropriate
- Compression middleware for reduced bandwidth

### Security Measures

Security is implemented via:

- Input validation and sanitization
- API request limiting
- Error message scrubbing
- Secure HTTP headers
- Environment configuration isolation

## Usage Scenarios

### Real-time Monitoring

Users can monitor current air quality conditions with:

- Live updates from connected sensors
- Visual indicators of air quality levels
- Alerts for threshold violations
- Contextual information based on WHO guidelines

### Historical Analysis

For historical data analysis, users can:

- Select specific date and time ranges
- Compare different time periods
- Identify trends and patterns
- Export data for external analysis

### Data Quality Assessment

The system helps ensure data reliability by:

- Validating sensor readings against expected ranges
- Identifying potential sensor malfunctions
- Highlighting data gaps or anomalies
- Providing data quality metrics

## Development and Maintenance

### Adding New Visualizations

The modular architecture allows easy addition of new visualization types:

1. Create a new visualization function in data-renderer.js
2. Add a new menu option in the dashboard interface
3. Configure any necessary data transformations
4. Register the visualization with the dashboard controller

### Extending Data Sources

To add new data sources:

1. Create a new service module for the data source
2. Implement standard data retrieval methods
3. Add appropriate data transformation for system compatibility
4. Register the new source with the data manager

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Connection Problems

- Check ThingSpeak API credentials
- Verify network connectivity
- Review API rate limits
- Ensure proper error handling for offline scenarios

#### Visualization Errors

- Verify data format compatibility
- Check for JavaScript console errors
